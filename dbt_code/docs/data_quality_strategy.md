# Data Quality Resolution Strategy# Data Quality Testing Strategy



## OverviewThis document outlines our approach to data quality testing and monitoring in the job market analytics project.

This document outlines our strategy for addressing the data quality issues identified in our dbt tests. Rather than immediately changing test severity levels or implementing fixes, we plan to address these issues systematically in upcoming sprints.

## Test Organization

## Strategic Approach

Our tests are logically organized into the following groups:

### Short-term (Current Sprint)

1. **Document and Acknowledge Issues**1. **Uniqueness and Not-Null Tests**

   - Maintain current test configurations to ensure visibility of issues   - Ensures primary key integrity

   - Document all known issues in the data_quality_issues.md file   - Validates that required fields are populated

   - Include issue context in schema.yml comments for clarity   - Examples: `unique`, `not_null`



2. **Impact Assessment**2. **Relationship Tests**

   - Evaluate business impact of each issue   - Validates referential integrity between tables

   - Prioritize issues based on severity and impact   - Ensures foreign keys properly link to dimension tables

   - Determine which issues require immediate attention versus longer-term solutions   - Examples: `relationships` tests between fact and dimension tables



### Medium-term (Next Sprint)3. **Column Value Expectation Tests**

1. **Root Cause Analysis**   - Validates data ranges and types

   - Investigate source data to understand the origin of quality issues   - Ensures data meets expected statistical properties

   - Analyze ETL processes for potential improvements   - Examples: `expect_column_values_to_be_between`, `expect_column_values_to_be_of_type`

   - Determine if issues are one-time or systematic

4. **Custom SQL Tests for Data Consistency**

2. **Implementation Plan**   - Validates business rules and cross-column logic

   - Develop specific solutions for each issue category:   - Identifies anomalies and inconsistencies

     - Missing values strategy (defaults, source improvements, etc.)   - Examples: `test_application_deadline_after_publication`

     - Duplicate handling approach

     - Data validation enhancements## Known Data Quality Issues

   - Create specific tasks for each solution component

Our testing has identified several data quality issues that need to be addressed:

3. **Test Refinement**

   - Develop additional custom tests to catch similar issues1. **Employers Missing Organization Numbers (19 records)**

   - Establish appropriate severity levels based on business needs   - Impact: Affects employer identification and linking

   - Implement monitoring for data quality metrics   - Recommendation: Validate employer data at source or implement a data cleansing step



### Long-term (Future Sprints)2. **Job Ads Missing Employer Information (21 records)**

1. **Process Improvements**   - Impact: These records can't be included in employer-based analyses

   - Enhance data intake validation   - Recommendation: Review job ads source data and ensure employer information is properly joined

   - Implement automated data quality monitoring

   - Develop dashboards for data quality metrics3. **Job Ads Missing Location Information (56 records)**

   - Impact: Geographical analyses will be incomplete

2. **Documentation Standards**   - Recommendation: Consider using default locations or enhance location mapping logic

   - Establish formal documentation for data quality exceptions

   - Create process for handling new data quality issues4. **Job Ads Missing Vacancy Counts (1 record)**

   - Maintain up-to-date data dictionary with quality expectations   - Impact: Minor impact on aggregate vacancy counts

   - Recommendation: Set default vacancy count of 1 for missing values

## Issue-Specific Resolution Timeline

5. **Duplicate Job Details IDs (5 records)**

| Issue | Priority | Sprint | Resolution Approach |   - Impact: Primary key violation that could affect data integrity

|-------|----------|--------|---------------------|   - Recommendation: Investigate source data for duplicate job_ad_ids or review surrogate key generation

| Missing Employer Organization Numbers | Medium | Sprint 2 | Investigate source data and add cleansing logic |

| Missing Employer IDs in Fact Table | High | Sprint 2 | Review join conditions and optimize employer matching |## Next Steps for Improving Data Quality

| Missing Location IDs in Fact Table | High | Sprint 2 | Enhance location mapping and implement defaults |

| Missing Vacancy Counts | Low | Sprint 3 | Add default value transformation |1. **Investigate Root Causes**

| Duplicate Job Details IDs | High | Sprint 2 | Review surrogate key generation and add deduplication |   - Analyze source data to understand why these issues are occurring

   - Determine if these are data entry errors or system issues

## Test Configuration Strategy

2. **Implement Data Cleaning**

Rather than adjusting test severity levels now, we will:   - Develop data cleaning steps in models to handle missing values

   - Consider using default values where appropriate

1. Maintain current test configurations to keep issues visible   - Address duplicate keys with appropriate deduplication logic

2. Use the documentation to track known issues

3. Consider implementing override configurations in the future for exceptional cases3. **Enhance Data Validation**

4. Develop custom tests that better reflect business rules   - Add additional custom tests for business rules

   - Implement automated monitoring for data quality metrics

## Success Metrics   - Create alerts for critical data quality issues



We will consider our data quality initiative successful when:4. **Document Exceptions**

   - For issues that can't be immediately fixed, document known exceptions

1. All critical issues (High priority) are resolved   - Use test severity levels (warn vs error) appropriately based on business impact

2. Medium and Low priority issues have documented resolution plans

3. Testing framework includes both technical and business rule validations5. **Continuous Improvement**

4. Regular data quality reporting is established   - Regularly review and update tests as data evolves
   - Add new tests when new data quality requirements emerge
   - Track data quality metrics over time to measure improvement
